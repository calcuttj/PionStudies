These are instructions on how to run the eSliceMethod_selectedInt.C to perform
the XS extraction.
Its also a document to not have Francescas memory forget what the steps are.


The relevant macros are in the github https://github.com/calcuttj/PionStudies
The relevant folder is rDataFrame and rDataFrame/eSliceMethod

------Preparation for eSlice Method -----------

   ---run rDataFrame/eventSelection.C
      to produce some necessary branches and perform the event selection
   
   ---run rDataFrame/dEdX_correction_try.C
      on the output of the eventSelection (mc_all/data_all)
      This produces the important h2 histos that contain dEdX
      calibrated/uncalibrated vs wire within the detector as well as
      trackPitch vs wire
   
   ---run rDataFrame/fit_dEdX_correction_try.C and
   rDataFrame/fit_dEdX_mc_validation.C
      this is for data and mc respectively. the above mentioned distributions
      of dEdX vs wire are fitted for each wire with a landau, the track Pitch
      vs wire with a gaussian
      everything is saved to output.root file sthat oyu need to pass on in the
      next macro
   
   ---run rDataFrame/eSliceMethod/eSliceMethod_*.C
      depending if you want to run the eSliceMethod on selected or true
      Interactions chose the macro
      include within the macro the correct fit outputs that you just produced
      in the step before.
      the output file of eSliceMethod contains the used h2's and histograms
